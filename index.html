<p><h3>Objective</h3>
Explore and talk about some ideas put forth by this student for a senior capstone project 
</p>
<hr>

<p><h3>Project Ideas</h3>
<h4> Automatic Trading Bot </h4>
A device built on the self learning principles of machine learning that would identify trading patterns breaking out in the past N trading candlesticks and would execute trades based on what it predicts will happen.
<h4> Boat Anti-Coast System </h4>
A device built into a boat uses GPS systems to slowly bring a boat back to sea when the depth of water is dangerously low. Would be able to control the throttle and rudder.

<h3>Experience</h3>
<p>
C# Online Game 													Spring 2019<br>
Designed and created both the server and user client for an online tank game. Scores were posted on a seperate SQL server hosted on the same machine and could be viewed through a browser.

<br>
<br>
FPGA Based Game													Fall 2020<br>
Designed, built, and tested a custom CPU on an FPGA board that was designed to play the game DoodleJump via pre-set OpCodes. Took in inputs via NES controller and displayed the character as a sprite on a VGA screen.

<br>
Intern, University of Utah College of Pharmacy                  Summer 2016<br>
University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, USA, 84112<br>
Studied cancer cell detection under (<a href="https://owenlab.com/page/2/">Dr. Shawn Owen</a>)

<h3>Expectation</h3><p>
Partners that are willing to work hard but not an unreasonable amount, preferably nearby Draper/Sandy.<br>
If working on the automatic trading bot, would prefer to have one hardware person. If the boat project is chosen, this would increase to two.<br>
Partners with relatively flexable schedules prefered, but not required. Available hours posted below.
